# Managing User Settings #

This guide explains the _UserSettings_ wizard. The wizard is launched on the user's home page in menu _Edit > User Settings_.

## Enabling/Disabling Root Menu Entries ##
Individual user can enable/disable root menu entries with the wizard User Settings (available on a user's Homage):

Once the wizard has loaded, uncheck entries you don't need (note that the settings can be different for different perspectives):

__NOTE:__ Please note that entries corresponding to packages disabled by the openCRX administrator cannot be enabled with this wizard. Packages disabled in web.xml are not available at all!

__NOTE:__ Depending on the width of your screen you can adjust the number of items shown as tabs in the top-level navigation in the same wizard by changing the value of Show max items in top navigation (fewer items for narrow screens, more items for wider screens).

__NOTE:__ If you uncheck Show top navigation sub-levels the top-level tabs will not contain menus for sub-levels.
